        <h2>position: static;</h2>
        <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page</p>

        <div class="static">
            This div element has position:static;
        </div>

        <h2>position: relative;</h2>
        <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>
        <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
            <div class="absolute">This div element has position absolute!!!</div>
        </div>
        <h2>position:absolute;</h2>
        <p>The above example shows how the div class="abs" is placed inside "relative" div</p>
        <p></p>

        <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
        <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>
        <div class="fixed">This div element has position: fixed;</div>
    </body>
